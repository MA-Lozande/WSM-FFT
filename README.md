# WSM-FFT
WSM wave packet simulation using FFT and EFDM

This repository contains simulations of wave packet propagation in tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Explicit Finite Difference Method (EFDM). The simulations demonstrate how the tilt parameter t in Weyl semimetals influences the dynamics of fermions, mimicking the behavior of massless particles (e.g., photons) in curved spacetime. By varying the tilt, we show that the trajectory of the wave packet follows geodesics analogous to those in general relativity, providing insights into black hole analogs and gravitational effects in condensed matter systems.
